<h3>Portfolio Website</h3>

<p>This page is one I had made and will build up upon to show my work and portfolio. So far in this page I have used HTML and CSS to build it. CSS was used for styling of nearly all the HTML elements. Also for the first time I utilised using viewport to keep layout a certain way. As I progress through the course, other languages will be used to add to the page more.

Different to previous pages is I have used a form, done through formspree.com, to collect information if someone is ever interested in working with me. My Linkedin and Instagram page are also made available by linking their logos', in the footer, to the relevant pages'.</p>
